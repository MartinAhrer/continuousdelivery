## Setup

The compose project name is set as global variable, alternatively we can just add `--project-name continuousdelivery` to each compose command.

[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
----

## Build

A build number is required for building all artifacts including the Docker image.

[source,bash]
----
: ${BUILD_NUMBER:=latest}
export BUILD_NUMBER
----

Build is running the following tasks

 * documentation tests,
 * build Spring JAR
 * build Docker context (Dockerfile, docker-compose scripts)

All compose triggered tasks that execute Gradle tasks have to run with the project root directory as current directory.

.Run tests and build the Docker context
[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
export PROJECT_DIR=$PWD
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/pipeline-build.yml run --rm build
----

.Build Application Image
[source,bash]
----
TODO
----

## Run integration test

This will startup a _production-like_ environment and runs a suite of integration tests.

[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
export BUILD_NUMBER=latest
export PROJECT_DIR=$PWD
# have to change to the directory containing the compose files, it also contains a .env file. TODO replace by values in the compose-file/exported variables
cd build/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f pipeline-integration-test.yml run --rm integration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f pipeline-integration-test.yml down -v
