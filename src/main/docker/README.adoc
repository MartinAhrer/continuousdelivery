== Setup

The compose project name is set as global variable, alternatively we can just add `--project-name continuousdelivery` to each compose command.

[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
----

== Build

A tag is required for building all artifacts including the Docker image.

[source,bash]
----
: ${APP_TAG:=latest}
export APP_TAG
----

Build is running the following tasks

 * documentation tests,
 * build Spring Boot JAR
 * build Docker context (Dockerfile, docker-compose scripts)

.Run tests and build the Docker context
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew buildDockerContext
----

.Gradle cache
----
docker volume create --name=dot_gradle
----

.Build Application Image
[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
docker-compose build
----

== Run integration test

This will startup a _production-like_ environment and run a suite of integration tests.

IMPORTANT: Run this from project root (or set the `PROJECT_DIR` variable properly).

[source,bash]
----
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=continuousdelivery
export APP_TAG=latest
export PROJECT_DIR=${PWD}
# have to change to the directory containing the compose files, it also contains a .env file. TODO replace by values in the compose-file/exported variables
cd build/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f pipeline-integration-test.yml run --rm integration-test
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f pipeline-integration-test.yml down -v
