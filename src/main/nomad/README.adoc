== Runtime infrastructure

== Consul + Nomad

=== Local development instances

Run consul and nomad service from repository (TODO).
Run as many Nomad clients as required.
However, when running multiple clients you will not be able to deploy traefik to all client nodes as the traefik job configuration tries to do a static port binding.

=== Remote development instances (cluster)

TODO
